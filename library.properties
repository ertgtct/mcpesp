sentence=ESP32 library for implementing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers
paragraph=This library provides a configurable implementation of the Model Context Protocol server for ESP32 devices. It allows you to create MCP tools that can be called via HTTP/JSON-RPC, enabling AI models and other clients to interact with your ESP32 hardware through a standardized protocol. The library includes support for tool registration, schema validation, and CORS headers for web-based clients.
